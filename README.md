# Smart Irrigation System using NodeMCU and Blynk

This repository contains the code for a Soil Moisture Measurement System with automatic pump control using an ESP8266 and Blynk IoT platform. The system monitors soil moisture levels, temperature, and humidity in real-time and automatically controls a water pump based on predefined conditions. It also allows manual control of the pump and an LED indicator via the Blynk app.

Features
**Soil Moisture Monitoring:** Uses an analog soil moisture sensor to determine moisture levels and displays the percentage in real-time.

**Automatic Pump Control:** The water pump is activated or deactivated automatically based on soil moisture levels.

**Temperature and Humidity Measurement:** Integrates a DHT11 sensor to measure and display environmental temperature and humidity.

**IoT Integration:** Real-time monitoring and control via the Blynk app using virtual pins.

**Manual Control Options:**
- **Water Pump:** Control the pump manually using the Blynk app (V4).
- **LED Indicator:** Toggle an LED manually using the Blynk app (V3).
